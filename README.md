# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose

This project's purpose is to develop a map consisting of all/major eathquakes and their relationship with Earth's tectonic plates. This is acheived by utilizing d3 to extract geoJSON data within Javascript, using Laaflet to build our web mapping application, and calling our Mapbox API to style our maps.
